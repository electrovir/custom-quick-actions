# Custom Quick Actions

# Usage

  1. Clone the repo
  2. Open each `.workflow` in Automator
  3. When asked `Do you want to install the “Copy path” quick action?` click `Install`
  4. Note that when you install a quick action, it will disappear from this folder (Automator _moves_ the workflow to `~/Library/Services` instead of copying the workflow.)
